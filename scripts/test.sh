# the image build that follows reuses this cached stage.

# BuildKit's local exporter keeps the file times of the stage it copies out of, so a cached test
# stage exports a report dated when the cache entry was written rather than now. Jenkins' junit step
# ignores result files older than the build start and then fails the build with "Test reports were
# found but none of them are new" — which reads as if the suite never ran.
#
# Backdating is safe to undo here: a cache hit means BuildKit matched the hash of the very sources
# under test, so this report belongs to this commit. Only its mtime is meaningless.
