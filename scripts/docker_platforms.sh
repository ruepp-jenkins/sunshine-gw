# Jenkinsfile and nothing else changes: the QEMU registration, the platform verification and the
# build flag all key off this one variable.

# Resolving the host from Docker rather than assuming amd64 matters. Both scripts previously
# defaulted to a hard-coded linux/amd64, so on an arm64 agent the "host only" path would have
# quietly emulated the entire build — the exact cost this is meant to avoid.

# platform it does not carry. Users would only find out on a pull. Checking here costs nothing and
